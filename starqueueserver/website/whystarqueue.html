<h2>Why StarQueue?</h2>
<hr/>
StarQueue programming can start within seconds and requires only sending an HTTPS POST.<br/>
<br/>
By contrast, many other message queues are:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>too complex</li>
    <li>heavyweight</li>
    <li>challenging to install</li>
    <li>difficult to configure</li>
    <li>have client software that requires special language specific drivers</li>
    <li>have client software that tends to be out of date of poorly maintained</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Instead of needing custom client drivers, StarQueue uses HTTP long polling which is effective for queue
receivers because it works well over standard Internet infrastructure and can be programmed with any modern
programming language.<br/>
